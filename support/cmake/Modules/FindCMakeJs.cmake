FindCMakeJs
--------

Find the native CMakeJs includes, source, and library

This module defines

::

  CMAKE_JS_INC, where to find node.h, etc.
  CMAKE_JS_LIB, the libraries required to use CMakeJs.
  CMAKE_JS_SRC, where to find required *.cpp files, if any
  CMAKE_JS_FOUND, If false, do not try to use CMakeJs.

also defined, but not for general use are

::

  MPEG_mpeg2_LIBRARY, where to find the MPEG library.
  MPEG_vo_LIBRARY, where to find the vo library.

# CMAKE_JS_INC is defined on all platforms when calling from cmake-js.
